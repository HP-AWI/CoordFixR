Description: This package calculates or converts coordinates of (nearly) all possible notations into decimal degrees. It does not matter whether degree, minute or second signs are included (e.g. '°'), whether spaces, underscores or slashes occur, whether designations such as north, south, west and east or minus signs (“-”) are included. Coordinates that contain text components such as “degrees”, “minutes” or “seconds” are also converted correctly without any problems.
