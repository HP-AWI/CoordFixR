Description: This package calculates or converts coordinates of (nearly) all possible notations into decimal degrees. It does not matter whether degree, minute or second signs are included (e.g. '°'), 
             whether spaces, underscores or slashes occur, whether designations such as north, south, west and east or minus signs (“-”) are included. Coordinates that contain text components such as 
             “degrees”, “minutes” or “seconds” are also converted correctly without any problems. The development of the 'CoordFixR' R-package is a result of the CoastCarb programme, funded under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No 872690.
